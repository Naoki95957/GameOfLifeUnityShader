# GameOfLifeUnityShader
This is just a little repo to dump an old project that I never really continued on with. I found the files on my old computer and wanted to back them up here. 

### Unity version 
Should be kind of updated. It should be easy to update to whatever version you want to use, but currently it is targeting 2019.3.0a11  

### How to use
There is an example script, object, and compute shader written. All you need to do in order to see the scene is really load the provided unity scene: 'MyScene.unity'
From there you can select the 'Quad' prefab in the scene and drop an input texture in the 'init Tex' field. Just remember to set the correct pixel width/height per texture
